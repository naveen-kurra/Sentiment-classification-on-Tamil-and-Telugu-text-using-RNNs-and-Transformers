# Sentiment-classification-on-Tamil-and-Telugu-text-using-RNNs-and-Transformers
Limited studies have been carried out to address the detection of sentiment in bilingual languages. The objective of this study is to review the major classifiers that could be used to classify the sentiment and evaluate its performance. Datasets that are available in various languages have been scarped up from various sources. Datasets that are found in kaggle and other social media are found to be specific to the languages.  Hence, one of the objectives of this work is to create a dataset which could be used for further research analysis. Models that have been used to the detection of sentiment is associated with the corresponding languages. The second objective is to develop a model which takes the input in the form of bilingual text. Here, the bilingual text comprises both Telugu and Tamil text. The novel approach in this work is that a single model could be developed for the bilingual text and it identifies whether the text is positive or negative. The next section provides you an overview of various research works that has been carried out for several languages. The third section describes about the proposed model and its architecture. There is a separate section to discuss in detail about the results and the performance of the model. Finally, the work concludes with the future scope.
